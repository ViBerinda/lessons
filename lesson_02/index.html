        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its
        body that
        turns yellowish-brown underneath. <span>
            turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its
            skin, an
            unusual trait among rodents.
            turns yellowish-brown underneath. </span> The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from
        over
        hair.
        <p>
            Adult capybaras grow <mark>to 106 to 134 cm</mark> (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24
            in) tall at
            the withers,
            and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9 kg (108
            lb). Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are 91 kg (201 lb) for a wild
            female
            from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay. Also, an 81 kg individual was reported in
            São
            Paulo in 2001 or 2002. The dental formula is
            1.0.1.3
            1.0.1.3
            . Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails.Their hind legs are slightly longer than their
            forelegs;
            they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet. Their muzzles are blunt, with
            nostrils,
            and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.

            Its karyotype has 2n = 66 and FN = 102, meaning it has 66 chromosomes with a total of 102 arms.

        <h2 id="ecology">Ecology</h2>
        Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries of South America except Chile.[19] They
        live in
        densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes,[14] as well as
        flooded
        savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath
        underwater for
        up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10
        hectares
        (25 acres) in high-density populations.[7]
        <p>
            Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are
            fairly common
            in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.[20] In 2011, one specimen was spotted
            on the
            Central Coast of California.[21] These escaped populations occur in areas where prehistoric capybaras
            inhabited; late
            Pleistocene capybaras inhabited Florida[22] and Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites in California and Hydrochoerus
            gaylordi in
            Grenada, and feral capybaras in North America may actually fill the ecological niche of the Pleistocene
            species.
        </p>

        <h2 id="diet-and-predation">Diet and predation</h2>
        Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,[14][24] as well as fruit and tree
        bark.[15] They
        are very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it.
        They
        eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass
        during the
        wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[26] Plants that capybaras eat
        during the
        summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.[25] The capybara's jaw
        hinge
        is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.[27] Capybaras are
        autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the
        cellulose
        in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They
        also
        regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] Like other rodents, a capybara's
        front
        teeth grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;[19] their cheek teeth also grow
        continuously.[27]
        <p>
            Like its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and
            capybaras not
            supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy.[30]

            The maximum lifespan of the capybara is 8 to 10 years,[31] but in the wild capybaras usually do not live
            longer than
            four years because of predation from South American big cats such as jaguars and cougars and from
            non-mammalian
            predators such as harpy eagles, caimans, green anacondas and piranhas .

        <h2 id="conservation-and-human-interaction">Conservation and human interaction</h2>
        Capybaras are not considered a threatened species;[1] their population is stable throughout most of their South
        American
        range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.[14][19] Capybaras are hunted for their meat and
        pelts in
        some areas,[40] and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some
        areas, they
        are farmed, which has the effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by
        their
        ability to breed rapidly.[19]
        <p>
            Capybaras have adapted well to urbanization in South America. They can be found in many areas in zoos and
            parks,[27] and
            may live for 12 years in captivity, more than double their wild lifespan.[19] Capybaras are docile and
            usually allow
            humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be
            vectors to Rocky
            Mountain spotted fever.[41] The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria asked Drusillas Park in Alfriston,
            Sussex,
            England, to keep the studbook for capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes
            information
            about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.[42]
        </p>
        <p>
            Capybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.[43] The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in
            some areas,
            while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein.[7] In parts of South America,
            especially in
            Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued
            special
            dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.[44] After several attempts a
            1784 Papal
            bull was obtained that allowed the consumption of capybara during Lent.[45][46] There is widespread
            perception in
            Venezuela that consumption of capybaras is exclusive to rural people.[47]
        </p>
        <p>
            In August 2021, Argentine and international media reported that capybaras had been causing serious problems
            for
            residents of Nordelta, an affluent gated community north of Buenos Aires built atop wetland habitat. This
            inspired
            social media users to jokingly adopt the capybara as a symbol of class struggle and communism.[48][49]
            Brazilian
            Lyme-like borreliosis likely involves capybaras as reservoirs and Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks as
            vectors.[50]

        <ol>
            <li>Largest Rodent: Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world. They can weigh between 77 and 146 pounds
                (35 to 66
                kilograms).</li>
            <li>
                Semi-Aquatic Lifestyle: They are well-adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle, often found in or near water
                bodies. Their
                webbed feet and streamlined bodies help them swim efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Social Animals: Capybaras are highly social and live in groups, often consisting of 10 to 20
                individuals, but sometimes
                up to 100 in larger groups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Herbivorous Diet: They primarily feed on grasses, aquatic plants, and fruit. They have a specialized
                digestive system
                with a complex stomach to help process their fibrous diet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gregarious Behavior: They engage in social grooming and other communal activities, which helps
                strengthen bonds within
                the group.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adaptable Breeders: They have a high reproductive rate, with females giving birth to 4 to 5 pups after a
                gestation
                period of about 150 days.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dense Fur: Their coarse, water-repellent fur helps keep them warm and dry while they are in the water.
